    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In class, we discussed a range of search algorithms. In this problem set, we will get some hands-on practice by implementing local search for the **Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP)**, which operates in a fully-observable, single-agent, deterministic, episodic, static, and discrete environment. We will also get some hands-on practice on Adversarial Search by coding an AI to play the game **Breakthrough**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Required Files**:\n",
    "* ps2.py\n",
    "\n",
    "**Plagiarism Policy**: Please refer to our [Course Policies](https://canvas.nus.edu.sg/courses/77861/pages/course-policies)\n",
    "\n",
    "**IMPORTANT**: While it is possible to write and run Python code directly in Jupyter notebook, we recommend that you do this Problem set with an IDE using the .py file provided. An IDE will make debugging significantly easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Post-Problem Set Survey**:\n",
    "Your feedback is important to us! After completing Problem Set 2, please take a moment to share your thoughts by filling out this [survey](https://coursemology.org/courses/3095/surveys/2714)."

This route must only visit each city **exactly once** and return to the headquarters to receive the next shipment. In addition, to save fuel cost, the route must be **as short as possible**. Given a list of cities and the distance between every two cities, what is the shortest possible route?\n",

    "With minimax, our agent can see the future within a few moves. However, the naive implementation of minimax may explore many redundant states, which slows down our agent. As discussed in the lecture, we can apply **alpha-beta pruning** to eliminate unnecessary states, thereby improving our agent's speed and its ability to see even further into the future. This will increase our agent's strength and its likelihood of winning the game. \n",
