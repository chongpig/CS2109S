    "\n",
    "The Missionaries and Cannibals (MnC) problem is a classic river-crossing logic puzzle. It is not difficult to solve this problem by hand when we have 3 Missionaries and 3 Cannibals. However, the solution becomes less obvious when we generalize the problem to *m* Missionaries and *c* Cannibals where *m* and *c* are some non-negative integers.\n",

    "The Missionaries and Cannibals problem is usually stated as follows: *m* missionaries and *c* cannibals are on the right side of a river, along with a boat that can hold at most 2 people. Your goal is to find a way to get everyone to the other side, without ever leaving a group of missionaries in one place outnumbered by the cannibals in that location (or the missionaries will get eaten!). You can try it here: https://javalab.org/en/boat_puzzle_en/ to test your understanding of the problem. \n",

    "Note that this algorithm may or may not be the best solution for this problem. The optimal algorithm will be used internally to test your solution on coursemology.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "1. `get_initial_state(m, c) -> state`: Return the starting state derived from m and c. This could be the state representation you described in task 1.1.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `get_max_steps(m, c) -> int`: Return a safe upper bound on how many moves the search should explore before giving up, this could be the upper bound you described in task 1.5.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `is_goal(m, c, state) -> bool`: Return True if the given state is a goal state, else False.\n",

    "5. `transition(state, action) -> state`: Apply the action and return the resulting next state.\n",
    "\n",
    "`mnc_search` takes two integers $m$ and $c$, which are the numbers of missionaries and cannibals on one side of the river initially, and returns the solution to the problem as a tuple of steps. Each step is a tuple of two numbers $m$ and $c$, indicating the number of missionaries and cannibals on the boat respectively as the boat moves from one side of the river to another. The odd steps are for the boat moving from right to left and the even steps are for the boat moving from left to right, assuming that we are counting from step zero in the tuple. Note that $1 <= c + m <= 2$, i.e. you need to have at least one person in the boat to row the boat from one side of the river to the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Worked Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that there are a **range** of possible solutions. This example is just one of them. Let us consider the case of 2 missionaries and 1 cannibal. One possible solution is as follows:\n",
    "- **Start:** 2 missionaries, 1 cannibal and the boat are on the RHS of the river\n",
    "- **Step 1:** 2 missionaries row the boat to the LHS of the river\n",
    "  \n",
    "   1 cannibal is on the RHS of the river. 2 missionaries and boat are on the LHS of the river\n",
    "   \n",
    "   **Note:** 1 cannibal and 0 missionaries on the RHS of the river is a valid state (0 missionaries is a valid state)\n",
    "- **Step 2:** 1 missionary rows the boat to the RHS of the river\n",
    "   \n",
    "   **Note:** 1 cannibal and 1 missionary on the RHS of the river is a valid state (no. of missionaries >= no. of cannibals)\n",
    "- **Step 3:** 1 cannibal and 1 missionary row the boat to the LHS of the river\n",
    "- **End:** 2 missionaries and 1 cannibal are on the LHS of the river\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, the solution is `((2, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1))`."

    "To allow you to focus on implementing search instead of having to set up states, the class `Cube` provided in `cube.py` supports the following methods:\n",

    "\n",
    "- `actions(state)`: returns a list of actions at the provided `state`.\n",

    "- `result(state, action)`: returns the new state after taking `action` from the provided `state`. It is deterministic.\n",

    "\n",
    "In the cube problem, the state of the cube is an instance of `State` class. It is a hashable type. `Action` in `Cube` is a tuple of an integer representing label and a string representing direction. Your search function should take and only take legal actions to transition from one state to another.\n",

    "### Task 2.5 - Uninformed vs Informed Search\n",
    "\n",
    "Compare the performance of the uninformed search algorithm from Task 2.4 with the informed search algorithm from Task 2.2. In particular, evaluate the number of nodes expanded which is equivalent to the time complexity for each approach. Provide an analysis of your findings, highlighting any differences in efficiency and effectiveness, and discuss the relations of the two algorithms (if any). "
